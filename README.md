# JavaScript Practice

This repository contains my practice files while learning JavaScript basics.

## Files
- **functions-and-objects.html**  
  Practice on defining functions, using multiple parameters, return values, conditional logic, and creating/modifying objects.

- **variables-and-loops.html**  
  Practice on variables, data types, arithmetic operations, and different types of loops (for, while, and conditional loops like FizzBuzz).

## How to run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open any `.html` file in your browser.
3. Open **Developer Console** (F12) to see the outputs.
